# OpenCode Plugin

This plugin integrates `claude-xmpp-bridge` with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

> **Claude Code users:** see [`examples/hooks/`](../hooks/) for the equivalent Claude Code hook scripts.

## What it does

- On startup: renames the GNU Screen/tmux window to `🧠<project>` and registers the active session with the bridge
- `session.created` (e.g. `/new`): registers the new session
- `session.deleted`: unregisters the session from the bridge
- `session.idle`:
  - sends the last assistant message via XMPP (switch: `notify-enabled`)
  - polls MCP inbox for pending inter-agent messages and injects them into the session
  - reports agent state `idle` to the bridge
- `permission.asked`: sends an informative XMPP notification showing what the AI wants to run — the actual approval/denial still happens in the OpenCode TUI (switch: `ask-enabled`)
- `permission.replied`: restores the window title after a permission dialog
- Reports agent state `running` when the model starts generating output

## Setup

The easiest way is the setup wizard:

```bash
claude-xmpp-bridge-setup
```

The wizard installs the plugin to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and merges the permission config into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

### Manual setup

1. Copy the plugin:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
   cp plugins/xmpp-bridge.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/
   ```

2. Merge `opencode.json` into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "permission": {
       "bash": "ask",
       "edit": "ask"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Enable notifications/permission alerts (both disabled by default):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/xmpp-notify
   touch ~/.config/xmpp-notify/notify-enabled   # session.idle → XMPP message
   touch ~/.config/xmpp-notify/ask-enabled      # permission.asked → XMPP notification
   ```

## On/Off Switches

The same switch files as Claude Code hooks:

| File | Controls | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `notify-enabled` | `session.idle` | Sends last assistant message via XMPP |
| `ask-enabled` | `permission.asked` | Sends informative XMPP notification about pending permission |

Enable: `touch ~/.config/xmpp-notify/<file>`
Disable: `rm ~/.config/xmpp-notify/<file>`

## Agent State and Plugin Version

The plugin reports its version (`plugin_version`) in the registration payload and keeps the bridge informed of agent state:

- `idle` — after registration and after each `session.idle` event
- `running` — when the model starts generating output

This information appears in `/list` output as `⏸`/`▶` icons and a `v0.7.4` tag.

## MCP Inbox Polling

The plugin polls the MCP server (`http://127.0.0.1:7878`) for messages sent by other agents via `send_message` or `broadcast_message`. Polling happens:

- Immediately on each `session.idle` event
- Every 30 s while the session is idle

Received messages are injected into the terminal via `claude-xmpp-client relay`.

## Coexistence with Claude Code

Claude Code and OpenCode sessions in the **same project directory coexist** — the bridge tracks them separately by `source`. Neither tool's session evicts the other's.

In `/list` output, OpenCode sessions are distinguished by the `🧠` prefix:

```
Sessions:
  /1 ~/projects/my-app [screen] *       ← Claude Code
  /2 ~/projects/my-app [🧠screen]       ← OpenCode
* = active session
```

## Dependencies

- `claude-xmpp-bridge` — must be running (via systemd or manually)
- `claude-xmpp-client` — socket client for bridge communication (relay, state, register, unregister, notify)
- GNU Screen or tmux
